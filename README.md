## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
- Carousel arrows were working properly and suddenly stopped. (might have saved a new update affecting it, but not sure which element is causing it exactly). Would be glad to hear a solution.
- The dropdown in the menu hides behind the slider. Tried z-index and other methods to bring it forward but didn't work. How to solve?
